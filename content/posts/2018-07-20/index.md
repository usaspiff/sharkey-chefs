Hummus

Ingredients
1/3 cup Tahini (Once Again Tahini works great)
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup lemon juice
1-1/2 can chickpeas (or 2 cups)
1 tsp salt
1 Tbsp olive oil
2 Tbsp chopped parsley

Mix then blend all the ingredients until creamy.

Note: You can save the aquafava from the chickpeas to use as egg replacer in other vegan recipes.
