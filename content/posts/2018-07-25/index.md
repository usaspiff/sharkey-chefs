Wild Rice Pilaf with Butternut Squash & Cranberries

1/2 medium butternut squash, peeled, seeded and cut into small cubes
1-1/2 cup wild rice, rinsed
3 cups vegetable stock (or half water, half stock)
1/2 large onion, chopped
1 cup dried cranberries
1/4 cup warm water
3 tablespoons chopped Italian parsley
1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 cup lemon juice
1/4 cup orange juice
Salt to taste

Preparation

Heat oven to 400 degrees.
Toss the butternut squash with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and sprinkle with salt. Spread the squash on a baking sheet. Roast until tender and starting to brown, about 20-25 minutes (check earlier if your pieces are very small).
Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a medium skillet. Saut√© the onion for 3-4 minutes.
Place the dried cranberries in a bowl with the warm water. Let sit for 10 minutes, then drain.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the remaining olive oil, orange juice, and lemon juice.
Place the wild rice and stock in a medium saucepan. Heat to a boil, then reduce heat, cover and simmer for 40 minutes, or until some of the grains start to split. The rice should still be quite chewy. Drain thoroughly and place in a large bowl. You can instead cook the rice with the stock in a rice cooker.
Add the onions, cranberries, parsley and dressing to the wild rice and stir. Gently mix in the roasted squash. Serve warm if possible, or at room temperature.
