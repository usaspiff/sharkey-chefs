Butternut Squash Soup

1 medium butternut squash, peeled and chopped into 1” cubes
4 cups chicken or vegetable stock (pls see stock restrictions on “Food Restrictions” doc)
1 yellow onion
1 small apple or pear, peeled and chopped into small cubes
1 TBSP olive oil
Salt to taste

Chop onion into small pieces and saute in olive oil on medium-low heat until translucent. (About 5 minutes)
Add in squash chunks and cover with enough broth that the top pieces are barely submerged.
Cover and simmer on low heat for 30 minutes or until the squash begins to be soft
Add in the apple or pear and cover for an additional 15 minutes
With a hand-held blender (or very carefully in a food processor), puree contents of pot.
Return to simmer, partially covered for 20 minutes.
Add salt to taste and serve.
