Beef Stock

Several lbs of grassfed beef marrow bones
2 bay leaves
1 TBSP apple cider vinegar
Coarsely chopped veggies:
1-2 carrots
2-3 celery stalks
1 medium onion
(or leftover scraps from the above veggies, saved in the freezer)
½ bunch parsley (add at end)
Water

Place the bones in a pot or slow cooker.  Cover with water and add 1TBPS vinegar.  Let soak for 15-20 minutes.  (If desired, bones can be roasted in a baking dish at 350 for one hour prior to soaking.  This enhances flavor but is not necessary.)
Add veggies or veggie scraps and bay leaves, and fill your pot with water, leaving at least one inch at the top for liquid to expand.
If using a slow cooker, set it to low, and let cook for 8-24 hours.
If using a pot on the stove, bring to a boil, remove scum from top, and then reduce to a simmer for 8-24 hours.
15 minutes before you stop cooking, add the parsley.
Remove from heat, strain out bones and veggies (bones can be saved in the freezer and used again for several cooks).
Enjoy.
